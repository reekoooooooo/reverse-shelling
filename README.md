Reverse Shell Simulation and Malware Analysis (Educational)
🔐 Project Title:
“Reverse Shell Simulation and Malware Analysis (Educational)”


Built and analyzed a simulated reverse shell using Python to better understand how remote access malware operates in real-world environments. The project was executed in a fully isolated virtual lab using Kali Linux, where I:

Developed the shell from scratch using raw sockets and subprocesses

Set up a Netcat listener to simulate an attacker's terminal

Monitored and analyzed network traffic using tcpdump

Demonstrated detection techniques using tools like netstat and ps aux

Outlined mitigation strategies and ethical safeguards
